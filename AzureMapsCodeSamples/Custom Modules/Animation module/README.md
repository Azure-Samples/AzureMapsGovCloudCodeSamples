# Animation Module

A library of map related animations. 

## Static methods

The following static methods are exposed on the `atlas.animations` namespace.

| Name | Return Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `drop(shapes: atlas.data.Point \| atlas.data.Feature<atlas.data.Point, any> \| atlas.Shape \| (atlas.data.Point \| atlas.data.Featuree<atlas.data.Point, any> \| atlas.Shape)[], dataSource: atlas.source.DataSource, height?: number, options?: DropAnimationOptions)` | PlayableAnimation | Adds an offset array property to point shapes and animates it's y value to simulate dropping. Use with a symbol layer with the icon/text offset property set to \['get', 'offset'\]. |
| `moveAlongPath(shape: atlas.Shape, path?: atlas.data.Position[] \| atlas.data.LineString \| atlas.Shape, options?: PathAnimationOptions)` | PlayableAnimation | Animates a Point shape along a path.  |
| `play(animations: PlayableAnimation[], options?: BaseAnimationOptions)` | GroupAnimation | Plays an array of animations at the same time. |
| `playInterval(animations: PlayableAnimation[], interval?: number, options?: BaseAnimationOptions)` | GroupAnimation | Plays an array of animations one by one based on an interval.  |
| `playSeq(animations: PlayableAnimation[], options?: BaseAnimationOptions)` | GroupAnimation | Plays an array of animations sequentially. |
| `setCoordinates(shape: atlas.Shape, newCoordinates: atlas.data.Position \| atlas.data.Position[] \| atlas.data.Position[][] \| atlas.data.Position[][][], options?: PathAnimationOptions)` | PlayableAnimation | Animates the update of coordinates on a shape. Shapes will stay the same type. Currently supports Point shapes. |
| `snakeline(shape: atlas.Shape, options?: PathAnimationOptions)` | PlayableAnimation | Animates the path of a LineString. |

## Classes and Option interfaces

The following classes and option interfaces are exposed on the `atlas.animations` namespace.

### GroupAnimation class

Group animation handler. 

**Methods**

| Name | Return Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `cancel()` |  | When called, will prevent any animation that hasn't already started in the group animation from starting. |
| `stop()` |  | Stops all animations and jumps to the final state of each animation. |


### PlayableAnimation class

 An abstract class which defines an animation that supports a play function.

**Methods**

| Name | Return Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `play(options?: BaseAnimationOptions)` |  | Plays the animation. |
| `stop()` |  |  Stops the animation and jumps to the final state of the animation. |

### BaseAnimationOptions object

**Properties**

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `autoPlay` | boolean | Specifies if the animation should start automatically or wait for the play function to be called. |
| `duration` | number | The duration of the animation in ms. Default: 100 ms |
| `easing` | string | The easing of the animaiton. |

### PathAnimationOptions object

Extends the BaseAnimationOptions object.

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `captureMetadata` | boolean | Specifies if metadata should be captured as properties of the shape. Potential metadata properties that may be captured: _heading |
| `geodesic` | boolean | Specifies if a curved geodesic path should be used between points rather than a straight pixel path. Default: false |

## Easings

The following easing names can be used with the animation library. See this [JavaScript Easing Functions site](http://andrewraycode.github.io/easing-utils/gh-pages) for examples of these easings.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| linear | linear easing function. |
| easeInSine | Slight acceleration from zero to full speed. |
| easeOutSine | Slight deceleration at the end. |
| easeInOutSine | Slight acceleration at beginning and slight deceleration at end. |
| easeInQuad | Accelerating from zero velocity. |
| easeOutQuad | Decelerating to zero velocity. |
| easeInOutQuad | Acceleration until halfway, then deceleration. |
| easeInCubic | Accelerating from zero velocity. |
| easeOutCubic | Decelerating to zero velocity. |
| easeInOutCubic | Acceleration until halfway, then deceleration. |
| easeInQuart | Accelerating from zero velocity. |
| easeOutQuart | Decelerating to zero velocity. |
| easeInOutQuart | Acceleration until halfway, then deceleration. |
| easeInQuint | Accelerating from zero velocity. |
| easeOutQuint | Decelerating to zero velocity. |
| easeInOutQuint | Acceleration until halfway, then deceleration. |
| easeInExpo | Accelerate exponentially until finish. |
| easeOutExpo | Initial exponential acceleration slowing to stop. |
| easeInOutExpo | Exponential acceleration and deceleration. |
| easeInCirc | Increasing velocity until stop. |
| easeOutCirc | Start fast, decreasing velocity until stop. |
| easeInOutCirc | Fast increase in velocity, fast decrease in velocity. |
| easeInBack | Slow movement backwards then fast snap to finish.  |
| easeOutBack | Fast snap to backwards point then slow resolve to finish. |
| easeInOutBack | Slow movement backwards, fast snap to past finish, slow resolve to finish. |
| easeInElastic | Bounces slowly then quickly to finish. |
| easeOutElastic | Fast acceleration, bounces to zero. |
| easeInOutElastic | Slow start and end, two bounces sandwich a fast motion. |
| easeOutBounce | Bounce to completion. |
| easeInBounce | Bounce increasing in velocity until completion. |
| easeInOutBounce | Bounce in and bounce out. |


## TODO - Roadmap

 - Allow looping of animations.
 - Add additional types of shape animations. 
    - translate line/polygons?
    - point drop in?
    - GPX animation?
    - route animation (points include speed and possibly acceleration)
    - Add property animation support for shapes and layers. 
    - tween/morph line/polygons on setCoordinates. 
	- Time series animations
    - Animated tile layers
	- Expanding/collapsing circle mask
    - Wrap map events and expose as playable animations.
 - Add easing examples, update animation options sample.
 - Events - onProgress, onEnd, on data point
 - Support for play, pause, stop for some animations.
 - Turn into a generic animation library. 
 - Consider reducing animated shapes classes down to a single class.
 - Expose easings as strings or function.
 - Consider removing type option from shape animation and automatically choose one based on the coordinate input.
 - Async animations for sequences of a set of animations. 
 - Add support for adding group animations into ply/playSeq/playInterval. Then we can mix an match to create long running complex combinations of animations.
